5. What I want this app to do: 
	User comes in, signs in/logs in, and gets to their special place 

	user writes down title and description of what they've done that day that makes them feel like they're part of a community, a nation, whatever, soemthing larger than themselves. 
		on this page, you can link to see all your actions: 

	user saves that

	user can view it, delete it

	user can return many times, add things, and see all of them. 

	On the user's page, they can write down 3 things that they hope to do -- but only 3. No good to get overwhelmed. Ie, a tiny todo/planner, with delete capacity. 

	--each user's page is private

	Home page -- you can see many of these things-- to get the effect of it. 

6. Create user and acts  DONE
	Later: create user_future_acts model, user has_many acts
	user ??
