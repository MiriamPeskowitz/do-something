# Do-Something

## Description
A Sinatra app that lets a user keep track of daily community/political actions. Because it's easy to lose track of how things add up. For more info, see https://miriampeskowitz.github.io/do-something_a_sinatra_app

### User stories include:
- You're an activist, and it can seem like the little things you do don't add up. That's discouraging.
- You forget all that you do, and you'd like a place to keep track of things. 
Big Picture User stories: 
- I want to build a sense of community in your neighborhood. Here's what I have done to do that, here's my community-building diary. 
- I want to run for committee-person in my city's ward system. I want a place to keep track of my journey. 
- I want to see what people do to make a difference; I love scrolling through to see what other people do. That inspires me.
