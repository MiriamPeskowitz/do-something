# Do-Something

## Description
A Sinatra app that lets a user keep track of daily community/political actions. Because it's easy to lose track of how things add up. For more info, see https://miriampeskowitz.github.io/do-something_a_sinatra_app

### User stories include:
- I'm an activist, and it can seem like nothing I do adds up. I forget all that I do, and I'd like a place to keep track of things. 
- I want to build a sense of community in my neighborhood. Here's what I have done to do that, a kind of community-building diary. 
- I want to run for committee-person in my city's ward system. I want to keep track of my journey. 
- I want to see what people do to make a difference; I may not keep my own page, but I'll definitely scroll through the ist of what people do, for inspiration. 

## Instructions/Install 

URL coming soon. Until then it can be forked and run on localhost.
