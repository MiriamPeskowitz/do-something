# Do-Something

## Description
A Sinatra app that lets a user keep track of daily community/political actions. Because it's easy to lose track of how things add up. For more info, see https://miriampeskowitz.github.io/do-something_a_sinatra_app

### User stories include:
- I'm an activist, and it can seem like nothing I do adds up. I forget all that I do, and I'd like a place to keep track of things. 
- I want to build a sense of community in my neighborhood. Here's what I have done to do that, a kind of community-building diary. 
- I want to run for committee-person in my city's ward system. I want to keep track of my journey. 
- I want to see what people do to make a difference; I may not keep my own page, but I'll definitely scroll through the ist of what people do, for inspiration.

## Contributors Guide 
Want to contribute? Send me some Github issues, whether it's bugs you've found (and how you found them), design/UX/UI features that can make DoSomethingNow easier to use.  

## Next features: 
	-- A way to share on Twitter, etc. 
	-- A 3-item to-do list where a user can store the next few things they want to do.
	-- "/welcome" -Add a range -- say, 30 lines of @thing, with option for full long list). List gets very long. 
	-- "futures/index"  Add edit and then delete buttons, and move top 3 to things/index, with a button to see full list of plans for the future. 
	-- on both lists, make sure all entries are unique. 
	-- UX, create nav bars for all buttons.
